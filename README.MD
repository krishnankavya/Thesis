#GPU Based Fluid Structure Interaction using Immersed Boundary Methods
##Author: Christopher Minar

###Abstract:  
Engineering applications often require fast, accurate solutions of fluid flow around freely moving bodies. 
The massive parallelism enabled by graphics processing unit (GPU) architecture enables high performance, offering a promising alternative to traditional solver acceleration via multicore central processing units (CPU). 
However, fully harnessing GPU parallelism requires specialized algorithms and computing strategies. 
This work modifies direct-forcing immersed boundary methods to model fluid-structure interaction and investigates this behavior on GPUs. 
I performed solver verification using lid-driven cavity flow, impulsively started flow over a cylinder, flow over a forced oscillating cylinder and vortex-induced vibration.
